# Snake Game Project

## Game Objective
The player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food. The primary goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while collecting as much food as possible.

## Implementation
The game is implemented using the Python programming language and the `pygame` library, which handles graphics, sound, and game controls.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The snake moves continuously in a specified direction, controlled by the arrow keys. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases.

## End Condition
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. At this point, the final score is displayed, and the player has the option to restart the game.
